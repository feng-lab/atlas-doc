Atlas is an open source software for biological-image visualization, suite for digital image processing, analyzing 2D & 3D image stacks, visualizes various surface objects, digitally reconstructed neurons, 3D reconstruction, user-defined annotations in 2D & 3D space, and displaying fuctional biological-image data, etc.

We propose Atlas as a software for productive collaboration between biological research and computer science communities.
     
It is available free in C source code format with some precompiled binaries for research purposes.
Download is available for Mac OS, Windows, Linux
