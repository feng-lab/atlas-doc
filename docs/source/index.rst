Atlas is an open source software for 3D/4D/5D digital image visualization, analyzing fluorescence microscopy 2D & 3D image stacks, cell signals, visualizes various surface objects, digitally reconstructed neurons, 3D reconstruction, user-defined annotations in 2D & 3D space, brain modeling, image stitching, human mri, and displaying fuctional biological-image data, etc.

We propose Atlas as a software for productive collaboration between biological research and bioimaging-informatics, and  computer science communities.
     
It is available free in C source code format with some precompiled binaries for research purposes.
Atlas SW Download is available for Mac OS, Windows, Linux
